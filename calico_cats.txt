The majority of calico cats are female, and if a calico is male, then he is actually intersex! This is because the gene for black and orange fur color is the same and it is on the X chromosome. If you imagine it like a lightswitch, it cannot be flipped to both black and orange, unless there are two X chromosomes (two seperate lightswitches). This would be the case for female calico cats (XX) or male cats with an extra X chromosome (XXY), which falls under the intersex umbrella.
