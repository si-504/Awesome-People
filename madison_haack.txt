Hello World!

Some fun facts about me...

I love to dance! In fact, I'm on the executive board for Swing Ann Arbor,
which is a student organization at U-M that celebrates Lindy Hop!
Lindy Hop is a Black vernacular dance form that is rooted in Harlem during the 20s and 30s.
I also dance Blues, when I'm lucky enough to find dance events that feature it!

Another fun fact....

I do indeed love coffee! I've been trying to visit every coffee shop in Ann Arbor.
There are plenty of mediocre coffee shops here, unfortunately.
However! Hyperion, Lab Cafe, and Undo (formally Ann Arbor Roasting Co.) have never done me wrong.

Thanks for reading :)
