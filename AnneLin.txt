I had completed both the Camino de Santiago in Spain and the Kumano Kodo in Japan which are two of the world’s most iconic pilgrimage routes in 2020. 
Not only did I challenge myself physically, but I also learned to enjoy the quiet moments on the trail, appreciate slow travel, and trust my own resilience. 
Finishing both routes earned me the “Dual Pilgrim” recognition, and it’s one of the achievements I’m most proud of.
