To make good espresso, use freshly roasted whole beans, ground just before brewing, and filtered water. Grind size is critical for controlling extraction time; aim for a \(1:2\) brew ratio (e.g., 18g of grounds to 36g of liquid espresso) in 25–30 seconds, adjusting the grind to achieve this. Ensure your puck is evenly distributed and tamped, preheat all equipment, and consistently use a scale to measure grounds and yield.
