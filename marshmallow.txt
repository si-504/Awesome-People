Ancient Egyptians made the earliest marshmallows over 4,000 years ago by extracting the sweet sap from the root of the marsh mallow plant. They would whip the sap with honey to create a soft, candy-like treat reserved for royalty and gods.

Today’s marshmallows no longer contain marsh mallow root—instead, they’re made with gelatin or egg whites, sugar, and corn syrup to achieve the fluffy texture. But the candy’s name still honors its botanical beginnings!

Marshmallows are awesome because can be eaten as is or added to desserts, hot chocolate, s'mores, and baked goods.
