I have learning painting for many years.
When I was a student in elementary school, I have studied Chinese traditional
painting and calligraphy for six years. I specialize in painting lotus flowers
and peonies.
During my freshman year in China, I majored in landscape architecture. At that
time, I learned sketching and landscape sketching. I excelled at landscape
sketching because I was good at converting what I saw to a painting. However,
I struggled with sketching because I couldn't render the gradations of light
and shadow.
