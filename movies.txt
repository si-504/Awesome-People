Movies are awesome because they teleport you to a different world.
You feel the emotions of the characters, you cry, you laugh, you feel disgusted.
I connect with movies all the time!
Whenever I have a bad day, I just go and watch a movie and my mood completely changes.
Watching movies helps me get out my spiral of thoughts.
Watching movies inspires me.
Watching movies teaches me life lessons.
Watching movies teaches me about different cultures and human behaviours.
This is why movies are awesome!!
